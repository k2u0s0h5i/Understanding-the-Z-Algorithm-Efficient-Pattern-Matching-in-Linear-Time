# Understanding-the-Z-Algorithm-Efficient-Pattern-Matching-in-Linear-Time
The Z algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern in a text. It constructs a Z array, storing information about matches between the pattern and text. This allows for linear-time searching, making it ideal for large texts.
